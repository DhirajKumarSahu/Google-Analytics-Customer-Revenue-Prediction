# Google-Analytics-Customer-Revenue-Prediction
Predicting the Revenue that the Customer would generate in the future based on his past activities

Most of the businesses hold the 80/20 rule, which says that only small percentage of Customers produce most of the revenue. Here we are challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. The outcome should help in making a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.
