Predicting the Revenue that the Customer would generate in the future based on his past activities

Most of the businesses hold the 80/20 rule, which says that only small percentage of Customers produce most of the revenue. Here we are challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. The outcome should help in making a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.

In Initial_Data_Cleaning Notebook, I removed the features which were of no use to the model.
In Data_EDA Notebook, I tried to visualize all the fetaures with respect to the feature to be predicted.
In Feature_Engineering_and_Model_Training Notebook, I did some feature engineering and trained various types of models.
In web_app.py, I used Strealit to create a web application out of the final model.
